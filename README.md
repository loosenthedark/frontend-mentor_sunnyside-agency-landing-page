### Useful resources

- ['Fixed page header overlaps in-page anchors'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4086107/fixed-page-header-overlaps-in-page-anchors) (Stack Overflow) was used to find a pure CSS workaround for this persistent issue caused by the site's `nav.fixed-top` covering the top portion of each anchor link area
- ['Hey, what about the figure element?'](https://css-tricks.com/quoting-in-html-quotations-citations-and-blockquotes/#hey-what-about-the-figure-element) from [this CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/quoting-in-html-quotations-citations-and-blockquotes/) was used as a reference in an effort to follow semantic HTML5 best practices when coding the site's ['Client Testimonials' `section`](https://loosenthedark.github.io/frontend-mentor_sunnyside-agency-landing-page/#clients)
- ['How to Apply CSS3 Transforms to Background Images'](https://www.sitepoint.com/css3-transform-background-image/) (SitePoint) was used to rotate one of the background images featured in the site's ['Services' `section`](https://loosenthedark.github.io/frontend-mentor_sunnyside-agency-landing-page/#services) 180 degrees on tablet and desktop
- [W3Schools HTML Colour Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) was used for generating on-the-fly colour pairings and modifications (lightening, darkening etc. of core project colours)
- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) was used to gauge the correct amount of `box-shadow` for the site's off-canvas `navbar-nav` menu on mobile
- [PicResize (online image editing tool)](https://picresize.com/) was used to crop and resize images
- [TinyJPG (online image compression tool)](https://tinyjpg.com/) was used for image compression
- [Responsively App](https://responsively.app/) was used to capture video of scrollable device emulators showcasing this solution's responsive mobile-first layout
- [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) was then used to convert this video to the `gif` format for inclusion in the [Screenshots](#screenshots) section of this Markdown file

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
